   This  competition  is  part  of  Mansoura  National  University's  strategy  aimed  at

   developing the intellectual and linguistic abilities of its students and introducing the
   values  of constructive criticism and quick thinking.


                              THEATRICAL ACTIVITIES



  Theatrical  activities  are  among  the
  most  prominent  student  activities
  that contribute to refining a student's

  personality  and  developing  their
  communication and creative abilities.
  By standing on stage, students learn

  public  speaking  skills  and  self-
  confidence,  develop  their  artistic
  sense,  and  the  ability  to  express

  thoughts and feelings in an impactful
  manner.  Theatre  also  represents  a
  spirit  of  cooperation  and  teamwork,

  requiring  its  members  to  work
  together in harmony and continuous

  coordination  for  the  success  of  the
  artistic work.
                                                      Two  of  our  faculty  students  participated  in  the

             A PAINTING REVEALING EMOTIONS ON MOTHER'S DAY





   Drawing is a universal language that

   exceeds  words.  It  allows  individuals

   to     express       their    feelings       and

   thoughts  in  a  creative  visual  style,
   developing  a  sense  of  beauty,

   precision,  and  attention  to  detail.

   When  the  subject  of  the  drawing  is
   motherhood,  it  becomes  more  than

   just  art;  it  is  an  honest  translation  of

   feelings  of  love,  tenderness,  and
   gratitude,  which  are  sometimes

   difficult to express in words.

    In an artistic touch during the faculty's Mother's Day celebration on March 19, creative

   student Mariam Abdel-Fattah painted a wonderful painting, expressing the beauty of
   motherhood and the depth of feelings of tenderness and giving. Through her painting,

   we saw a mother's embrace, the warmth of her gaze, and everything that cannot be

   expressed in words. We salute this distinguished talent, whose colors represented the

                                  Undergraduate Students

             Academic  supervision  for  undergraduate  students  is  a  cornerstone  of

             effective university education, playing a critical role in guiding students

             through  the  academic,  personal,  and  professional  challenges  they

             encounter  during  their  studies.  It  is  a  structured  process  in  which
             academic staff provide ongoing support, mentorship, and guidance to

             students from the beginning of their university journey until graduation.

   The Importance of the

   Arctic in Regulating the

   World's Climate


   The environmental stress that occurs in the Arctic not only affects the region itself, but also
   has an impact on the global climate. Because the Arctic influences wind and ocean patterns,
   temperature changes here will have an impact on the climate around the world.




            The  Arctic  serves  as  the  Earth's  cooling
            system by reflecting sunlight.

            Low  Arctic  temperatures  affect  global
            weather patterns, including air and ocean
            circulation.
            Melting Arctic ice is accelerating climate
            change and worsening extreme weather,
            such as storms and heat waves.]]></page><page Index="203"><![CDATA[Greenhouse Gas Emissions
